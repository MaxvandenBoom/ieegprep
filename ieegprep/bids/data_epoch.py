                                            the signal in the period from 1s before the trial onset to 3s after trial onset).
        baseline_norm (None or str):        Baseline normalization setting [None, 'Mean' or 'Median']. If other than None,

        line_noise_removal (None or int):   Whether to preprocess with line-noise removal. If an integer (e.g. 50 or 60) is
                                            passed, then a notch filter will be applied around that number. Passing None
                                            will disable line-noise removal.

    Load, epoch and return the average for each channel and condition (i.e. the signal in time averaged
    over all trials that belong to the same condition).

    Note: Because this function only has to return the average signal for each channel and condition, it is much more
          memory efficient (this is particularly important when the amount of memory is limited by a Docker or VM)
    Note 2: For the same reason, metric callbacks are implemented here, so while loading, but before averaging, metrics
            can be calculated on subsets of data with minimum memory usage. If memory is not an issue,
            load_data_epochs function can be used to retrieve the full dataset first and then perform calculations.

        late_reref (None or RerefStruct):     Preprocess with late (after line-noise removal) re-referencing. Generate a
                                              RerefStruct instance using one of the factory methods (e.g. generate_car) and

        preproc_priority (str):              Set the preprocessing priority, can be set to either 'mem' (default) or 'speed'

    Returns:
        sampling_rate (int or double):        The sampling rate at which the data was acquired
        data (ndarray):                       A three-dimensional array with signal averages per channel and condition
                                              (format: channel x condition x samples); or None when an error occurs
        metrics (ndarray):                    If metric callbacks are specified, will return a three-dimensional array

    After preprocessing, the channel data is either epoched and returned in a matrix (format: channel x trials/epochs x time),
